## Notes

Here I will be adding a short note for each session that I sit down to watch the tutorials.

## 1 : Creating an Entry point

* Videos covered - Upto "Entry Point"
* Time taken : 1 hour
* New things discovered :
  * DLL exporting and importing functions/variables/classes with extern keyword.
  * Linking two projects together, where one is a client app and the other is a library app.
  * Setting a useful build directory. (Eased a lot of problems I was having)
  * Creating an interface that rids the user of any ground level work, e.g. seeing the main function or creating essential classes for core functionalities.

* Curiosities :
  * How do DLL exports or its equivalent technologies work in Linux or Mac? Concepts of DLLs seems to exist only in Windows.
